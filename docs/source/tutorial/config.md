# Create Your First Agent in Minutes! 🚀

Want to build your own AI agent? With Synthora, it's as easy as creating simple YAML files! Let's start with a basic version and then add more capabilities.

## Basic Version: Simple Conversational Agent 💬

### What You'll Need ✨
Just two configuration files:
1. An agent config file (defines agent behavior)
2. A model config file (sets up the AI model)

### 1️⃣ Agent Configuration (basic_agent.yaml)
```yaml
name: basic-assistant
type: vanilla
model: !include basic_model.yaml  # Points to your model config
prompt: "You are an AI Assistant. You are here to help me with my queries."
```

### 2️⃣ Model Configuration (basic_model.yaml)
```yaml
name: basic-model
model_type: gpt-4
backend: openai_chat
backend_config:
  api_key: "your-api-key"
config:
  temperature: 0
  top_p: 1.0
  stream: true
```

### Let's Try It! 🎮
```python
from synthora.agents import VanillaAgent
from synthora.configs import AgentConfig
from synthora.callbacks import RichOutputHandler

# Load your agent's configuration
config = AgentConfig.from_file("examples/agents/configs/basic_agent.yaml")

# Create your agent with nice output formatting
agent = VanillaAgent.from_config(config)
handler = RichOutputHandler()
agent.add_handler(handler)

# Start chatting!
agent.run("What is artificial intelligence?")
```

## Advanced Version: Adding Search Capabilities 🔍

Let's upgrade our agent by adding search capabilities! Here's how:

### 1️⃣ Enhanced Agent Configuration (search_agent.yaml)
```yaml
name: search-assistant
type: vanilla
model: !include basic_model.yaml
prompt: "You are an AI Assistant with search capabilities. You can search the web to answer questions."
tools:
  - synthora.toolkits.SearchToolkit  # Adds search functionality! 🔍
```

The model configuration remains the same, but now your agent can search the web!

### Try Your Enhanced Agent! 🚀
```python
# Load the enhanced configuration
config = AgentConfig.from_file("examples/agents/configs/search_agent.yaml")

# Create your search-capable agent
agent = VanillaAgent.from_config(config)
handler = RichOutputHandler()
agent.add_handler(handler)

# Test the search functionality
agent.run("Search OpenAI on Wikipedia")
```

## What Makes It Special? ⚡

- **Simple Setup**: Start with basic chat and add tools as needed
- **Powerful AI**: Powered by OpenAI's GPT-4
- **Extensible**: Easy to add more capabilities
- **Beautiful Output**: Clean formatting to track agent actions

That's it! You've learned how to create both a basic chatbot and a search-capable AI agent. Amazing what a few lines of code can do! 😎
