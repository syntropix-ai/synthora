# Prompt

The `Prompt` functionality in `synthora` provides a way to create and manage customizable prompt templates with dynamic argument formatting. This system integrates with agents like `VanillaAgent` and allows for flexible prompt handling during runtime.

---

## Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use `BasePrompt` with a `VanillaAgent`:

```python
from synthora.agents.vanilla_agent import VanillaAgent
from synthora.callbacks import RichOutputHandler
from synthora.prompts import BasePrompt

# Define a prompt template
prompt = BasePrompt("Your name is {username}.")

# Create a default VanillaAgent using the prompt and a callback handler
agent = VanillaAgent.default(prompt, handlers=[RichOutputHandler()])

# Run the agent with input and a template argument
agent.run("what is your name?", username="John Doe")
```

### Output
The agent will dynamically replace `{username}` in the prompt with `"John Doe"` and process the query accordingly.

---

## BasePrompt Class

The `BasePrompt` class extends Pythonâ€™s built-in `str` class, adding functionality for working with template strings and argument validation.

### Key Features

1. **String-like Behavior**
   - `BasePrompt` is a subclass of `str`, so it behaves like a standard string.

2. **Template Argument Extraction**
   - Dynamically extracts placeholder arguments from a template.

3. **Safe Formatting**
   - Validates arguments against the template and only substitutes recognized placeholders.

4. **Integration with Pydantic**
   - Supports serialization through Pydantic for seamless configuration handling.

---

### Properties and Methods

#### `args` (Property)

Extracts all unique placeholders (arguments) in the prompt template.

##### Example
```python
prompt = BasePrompt("Your name is {username} and your role is {role}.")
print(prompt.args)  # Output: {'username', 'role'}
```

#### `format` (Method)

Formats the prompt template by substituting placeholders with the provided arguments. It ensures that only the placeholders present in the template are replaced.

##### Parameters
- `**kwargs`: Key-value pairs for substituting template placeholders.

##### Example
```python
prompt = BasePrompt("Your name is {username}.")
formatted_prompt = prompt.format(username="Alice")
print(formatted_prompt)  # Output: "Your name is Alice."
```

### Built-in Prompts

The following table summarizes the built-in prompts provided in `synthora`, their purposes, and typical use cases:

| **Prompt Name**              | **Description**                                                                                   | **Use Case**                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ZeroShotCoTPrompt`          | A prompt designed for zero-shot chain-of-thought reasoning, encouraging step-by-step explanations. | Use when requiring the model to provide detailed reasoning without prior examples.          |
| `ZeroShotReactPrompt`        | A zero-shot prompt for reasoning and acting (ReAct) in tasks requiring a mix of analysis and action.| Suitable for scenarios requiring both reasoning and action, without additional examples.     |
| `FewShotReactPrompt`         | A few-shot ReAct prompt providing the model with examples to guide reasoning and action.           | Use when examples improve performance in reasoning and acting tasks.                        |
| `ZeroShotTOTProposePrompt`   | A zero-shot Tree-of-Thought (ToT) prompt for proposing multiple reasoning paths.                   | Ideal for brainstorming or exploring diverse problem-solving approaches.                    |
| `ZeroShotTOTEvalPrompt`      | A zero-shot ToT evaluation prompt for assessing and ranking proposed solutions or ideas.           | Use when evaluating multiple proposed solutions to select the best one.                     |
| `VanillaPrompt`              | A simple, general-purpose prompt template for straightforward interactions.                        | Suitable for standard queries where minimal guidance is required.                           |

These prompts are pre-configured to cover a wide range of interaction styles and can be customized further as needed for specific applications.

## Summary

The `BasePrompt` class provides a robust and extensible way to handle dynamic prompt templates in `synthora`. By leveraging its integration with agents, templates, and Pydantic, it simplifies the process of creating personalized and context-aware AI interactions.
