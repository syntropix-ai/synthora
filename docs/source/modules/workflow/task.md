# Task

Synthora is a flexible workflow system inspired by tools like Celery, designed to orchestrate tasks in serial and parallel workflows with high customization capabilities. In this document, we will focus on **Tasks**, one of the fundamental building blocks of Synthora workflows.

---

## Task Overview

A **Task** in Synthora represents the smallest unit of execution. It can be a function or a callable object that performs a specific operation. Synthora provides multiple ways to define tasks and allows users to extend their behavior with advanced features like **signatures** and **immutability**.

---

### Defining Tasks

Tasks in Synthora can be created in two ways:

1. **Using Decorators**:
   Use the `@task` decorator to define a task with additional configurations.
   ```python
   from synthora.workflows import task

   @task
   def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
       return x + y
   ```

2. **Using Classes**:
   Use the `BaseTask` class to define a task manually, especially when you need more control.
   ```python
   from synthora.workflows.base_task import BaseTask

   def multiply(x: int, y: int) -> int:
       return x * y

   multiply_task = BaseTask(multiply, name="multiply_task")
   ```

---

### Task Signature

**Signatures** in Synthora allow you to predefine and lock task parameters. This feature simplifies the reuse of tasks and helps build predictable workflows.

#### Predefining Task Parameters
A task signature can be used to set default arguments:
```python
add_task = add.s(1)  # Predefine the first parameter as 1
result = add_task(2)  # Executes add(1, 2) and returns 3
```

You can also achieve this using:
```python
add_task = add.signature(1)
```

#### Immutable Parameters
By default, task signatures are mutable, allowing additional arguments to be passed during execution. However, Synthora supports **immutable signatures**, ensuring the task ignores any external arguments and only uses predefined parameters.

Example:
```python
add_task = add.si(1, 2)  # Immutable signature
result = add_task(3, 3)  # The external arguments are ignored; executes add(1, 2) and returns 3
```

Alternate ways to create immutable signatures:
```python
add_task = add.signature(1, 2, immutable=True)
# or
add_task = add.signature_immutable(1, 2)
```

**Error Example**:
If a mutable signature is used and too many arguments are provided, an error is raised:
```python
try:
    add_task(1, 2, 3)  # Too many arguments
except TypeError as e:
    print(e)
# Output: add() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given
```

---

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Basic Task Execution
```python
@task
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

greet_task = greet.s("Alice")
print(greet_task())  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

#### Example 2: Using Signatures
```python
@task
def divide(x: int, y: int) -> float:
    return x / y

divide_task = divide.s(10)  # Predefine the numerator as 10
print(divide_task(2))  # Output: 5.0
```

#### Example 3: Immutable Parameters
```python
@task
def power(base: int, exp: int) -> int:
    return base ** exp

immutable_task = power.si(2, 3)  # Locks the parameters
print(immutable_task(4, 5))  # Output: 6 (only 2**3 is executed)
```

---

### Benefits of Task Signatures

1. **Reusability**: Signatures allow you to reuse tasks with preconfigured parameters.
2. **Consistency**: Immutable signatures ensure predictable behavior, unaffected by external inputs.
3. **Simplified Workflows**: Chaining tasks with signatures reduces boilerplate code.

Synthoraâ€™s approach to task signatures and immutability is inspired by Celery, a popular distributed task queue. However, Synthora enhances flexibility by integrating these features into a broader workflow orchestration system.

This concludes the first part of the Synthora documentation on **Tasks**. In subsequent sections, we will explore **Schedulers** and **Contexts**, completing the picture of how Synthora orchestrates workflows.
