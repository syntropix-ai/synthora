# Agent in `Synthora`

The **Agent** is one of the core components of Synthora, built on top of the model layer to provide extended functionality. It allows users to seamlessly interact with tools and other agents, simplifying complex workflows.

---

### Key Features of Synthora Agents

#### 1. **Agent as a Tree Structure**
Agents in Synthora are organized as an **Agent Tree**, where:
- **Nodes**: Represent individual agents.
- **Leaves**: Can be tools or other agents.

This design enables agents to either directly invoke tools or leverage other agents to enhance problem-solving capabilities.

#### **Benefits of the Tree Structure**:
- **Modularity**: Agents and tools can be reused across different tasks.
- **Scalability**: The tree can grow dynamically as more tools or agents are added.
- **Problem Decomposition**: Complex problems can be broken into smaller tasks, distributed across different branches of the tree.

### Predefined Agents in Synthora

Synthora provides several predefined agents that embody common reasoning and interaction paradigms:

1. **Cot (Chain-of-Thought)**:
   - Encourages the agent to generate intermediate reasoning steps before arriving at a final solution.
   - Ideal for problems requiring multi-step reasoning.

2. **ToT (Tree-of-Thought)**:
   - Expands upon Cot by enabling the agent to explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously.
   - Facilitates parallel exploration of solutions.

3. **ReAct (Reasoning and Acting)**:
   - Combines reasoning with action execution.
   - Useful for tasks requiring real-time interaction with tools while reasoning through the problem.

### Summary

Synthora's agent system provides:
1. **A flexible tree-based architecture**, allowing agents to invoke tools or other agents.
2. **Modular design**, enabling scalability and reusability.
3. **Predefined agent types** (Cot, ToT, ReAct) tailored to different problem-solving strategies.

By combining these features, Synthora empowers users to solve complex tasks efficiently while leveraging the full power of tools and collaborative agents.
