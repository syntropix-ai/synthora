      "1. **Regular Octagon**: A regular octagon has 8 vertices.\n",

      "### Current Problem:\n",
      "We need to find out how many different triangles can be formed using any of these 9 points (8 vertices of the octagon plus the center of the circle) as vertices for the triangles.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Determine Possible Combinations\n",
      "To find the number of triangles, we will:\n",
      "   - Consider all combinations of 3 points from these 9 points.\n",
      "   - Calculate how many of these combinations form non-degenerate triangles (i.e., triangles with non-zero area).\n",
      "\n",
      "With this approach, let's first count how many possible combinations of 3 points there are from the 9 points.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Think**: Use the combination formula for choosing 3 points out of 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The combination formula is given by \\( \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\).\n",
      "- Calculate \\( \\binom{9}{3} \\).\n",

      "Let's proceed with calculating \\( \\binom{9}{3} \\).\n",
      "To calculate the number of ways to choose 3 points from the 9 available points (the 8 vertices of the octagon plus the center of the circle), we use the combination formula: \n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "\\binom{9}{3} = \\frac{9!}{3! \\times (9-3)!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 84\n",
      "\\]\n",

      "**Output**: There are 84 ways to choose any 3 points from the 9 available points.\n",

      "### Step 3: Verify Non-Degenerate Triangle Combinations\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of our problem, we need to determine if any of these 84 combinations result in degenerate triangles. There are a few specific cases to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Degenerate Case**: If the triangle has three collinear points, it would have zero area.\n",
      "2. **Collinear Points Consideration**:\n",
      "   - **All 3 Vertices on the Octagon**: Any combination of 3 out of the 8 vertices of the octagon will not be collinear since a regular octagon is a convex polygon and any combination of 3 vertices forms a triangle.\n",
      "   - **2 Vertices on the Octagon and the Center**: Since the center is not on any edge of the octagon, any two vertices of the octagon with the center will form a non-degenerate triangle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given these considerations, all combinations of 3 points among the 9 available (8 vertices and 1 center) will form non-degenerate triangles.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Output**: All 84 combinations form valid triangles, with no degenerate cases. \n",

      "\n",
      "- There are 84 ways to choose any 3 points from these 9 points.\n",
      "- All of these combinations result in valid, non-degenerate triangles due to the nature of a regular octagon and the central point.\n",

      "**Verification**: Since we ensured that none of the combinations results in collinear points when choosing from the available vertices, the entire set of combinations results in valid triangles.\n",
