# Syntropic
Syntropic is a lightweight and extensible framework for LLM-driven Agents and ALM research. It provides essential components to build, test and evaluate agents. At its core, Syntropic aims to assemble an agent with a single config, thus minimizing your effort in building, tuning, and sharing agents.
