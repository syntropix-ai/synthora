# **Think**: Begin by considering different combinations and operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with the numbers 4, 9, 10, and 13 to see if it's possible to achieve the total of 24.

# **Observe**: Start with testing simpler combinations. For instance, check if two numbers could combine with a basic operation to create an intermediary sum or product that is closer to 24.

# **Test**: Check if any simple two-number operation reaches an intermediary number close to 24.
# - 4 + 9 = 13
# - 4 + 10 = 14
# - 4 + 13 = 17
# - 9 + 10 = 19
# - 9 + 13 = 22
# - 10 + 13 = 23

# None of these combinations directly yield 24. Let's explore the possibility of using each on numbers instead.
# **Think**: To determine if the numbers 4, 9, 10, and 13 can reach the total of 24 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), I need to start by testing simple combinations of these numbers with the operations.

# **Observe**: Let me try a simple combination using these numbers:
# \[ (10 + 13) - (9 - 4) \]

# **Output**:
# \[ (10 + 13) - (9 - 4) = 23 - 5 = 18 \]

# Since this does not yield 24, further combinations need to be tested.

# ---

# Let's try another combination, using the operations differently or pairing the numbers in a different way for the next step.
# **Think**: To determine if the numbers 4, 9, 10, and 13 can be used to form the number 24 using basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), I'd first try to identify some possible operations or combinations to attempt with these numbers.

# **Observe**: Check a straightforward or potential combination that might lead to 24 by either adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing the numbers. Let's start by trying a simple combination to test: \( 13 + 9 + 4 - 10 \).

# Try this step and see if it equals 24.
# [0.5, 0.5, 0.4]
# **Think**: Since no simple two-number combination worked, try combining three numbers with basic operations to get closer to 24.

# **Observe**: Look at possible combinations with three numbers:
# - (4, 9, 10): Try calculating combinations of three numbers like (4 * 9) / 10.

# **Test**: Calculate (4 * 9) / 10.
# 4 * 9 = 36;
# 36 / 10 = 3.6

# This doesn't result in 24, so we need to try other three-number combinations.
# **Think**: Consider combining three numbers using addition or subtraction to get a number closer to 24, which might then be adjusted using the fourth number.

# **Observe**: Try combinations of three numbers to see if they come close to, or equal to, 24.

# **Test**:
# - 4 + 9 + 10 = 23
# - 4 + 9 + 13 = 26
# - 4 + 10 + 13 = 27
# - 9 + 10 + 13 = 32

# These combinations do not equal 24 or allow easy adjustment using the fourth number. Next, consider operations involving multiplication or division among these pairings.
# **Think**: Next, consider using multiplication or division to reach closer to 24 or to modify the existing numbers to form intermediary targets that help reach 24 through subsequent operations.

# **Observe**: Test combinations using one multiplication or division operation.
# - 4 × 9 = 36
# - 4 × 10 = 40
# - 4 × 13 = 52
# - 9 × 10 = 90
# - 9 × 13 = 117
# - 10 × 13 = 130

# Similar cases for division would be irrelevant or lead to non-integral results due to the lack of compatibility across numbers.

# Try a subtraction yet close to 24 potential sums produced from straightforward addition or multiplication. For example, 10 × 2 could reach 20, and further adding 4 could produce 24.

# Observe that a straightforward operation through these numbers may not achieve a result of 24 straightforwardly. Let's consider fewer direct approaches next to manipulate or recombine a potential result integer close to sum distinction like shrinking larger products into attainable operations.
# [0.9, 0.0, 0.0]
# **Think**: Since the previous combination didn't work, explore further combinations using three numbers with different operations.

# **Test**: Try using a different combination or operation, such as (9 + 10 + 4) - 13 or another similar formula, to see if it approaches 24.

# - 9 + 10 + 4 = 23
# - 23 - 13 = 10

# Observe: This also doesn't yield the desired result. Continue testing other combinations.
# **Think**: Evaluate more combinations of three numbers and operations to target closer to 24. Focus on operations that yield higher values since we aren’t reaching enough with addition.

# **Observe**: Try another combination like (10 * 4) - (9 + 13).

# **Test**: Calculate (10 * 4) - (9 + 13) for a target close to 24:
# - 10 * 4 = 40;
# - 9 + 13 = 22;
# - 40 - 22 = 18.

# We still haven't reached 24. Let's try another approach with different operations on a set of three numbers.
# **Think**: Try using different operations and re-evaluate previous combinations now considering different orders or groupings that might yield 24.

# **Observe**: Let's try another combination using three numbers, such as (10 * 9) / (13 - 4).

# **Test**: Calculate (10 * 9) / (13 - 4).
# 13 - 4 = 9;
# 10 * 9 = 90;
# 90 / 9 = 10

# This doesn't result in 24. Try different sets or approaches with these numbers.
# [0.3, 0.6, 0.8]
# **Think**: We need to explore more complex operations or sequences with the four numbers since simpler three-number solutions haven't reached 24 yet.

# **Test**: Try performing operations involving all four numbers, such as:

# - \( (9 \times 4) - 10 + 13 \)

# **Observe**: Calculate the result:
# - Multiply 9 by 4: \( 9 \times 4 = 36 \)
# - Subtract 10: \( 36 - 10 = 26 \)
# - Add 13: \( 26 + 13 = 39 \)

# This combination does not give 24. Let's continue exploring other sequences.
# **Think**: Since previous attempts have not worked, try using a combination of operations that might be less straightforward, or consider possible expressions that use multiplication and division strategically.

# **Test**: Try another combination, such as (13 - 10) * (9 - 4).

# **Observe**: Calculate the result:
# - 13 - 10 = 3
# - 9 - 4 = 5
# - 3 * 5 = 15

# This doesn't result in 24, so it's time to attempt other combinations.
# **Think**: Shift focus to exploring combinations that initially yield higher numbers before subtractions, as the previous attempts either fell short or were too low. Use multiplication and division for larger intermediary results.

# **Observe**: Try a different concept. For example:
# - Combine through multiplication or division like (13 * 4) or other combinations, then adjust using addition or subtraction.

# **Test**: Calculate 13 * 2 - (the leftover numbers).
# - 13 * 2 = 26

# Then consider using 26 - 10 - 4 = 12 (as a verification or offset).

# Let's verify step-by-step within possible combinations as part of analyzing this directional approach or if alternates should be worked out.
# [0.1, 0.1, 0.0]
# **Think**: Try using another approach by attempting a different order of operations or combinations to reach 24.

# **Observe**: Consider the impact of trying combinations using the four operations to balance; check if using addition and multiplication first aids reaching 24, such as within (4 + 13) * (10 - 9).

# **Test**: Calculate (4 + 13) * (10 - 9):
# - 4 + 13 = 17;
# - 10 - 9 = 1;
# - 17 * 1 = 17.

# This still doesn’t yield 24. Other combinations need to be evaluated.
# **Think**: Test another combination of operations to get closer to 24 using the remaining numbers. Consider using division and multiplication to reach higher values.

# **Observe**: Attempt combining multiplication with division, such as 13 * 10 /4.

# **Test**: Calculate 13 * 10 / 4:
# - 13 * 10 = 130;
# - 130 / 4 = 32.5.

# This doesn't result in 24 either. Continue to experiment with the remaining numbers and operations.
# **Think**: Consider using multiplication and alternative subtraction sequences to explore different potential paths to 24. Prioritize a different set of numbers, such as including 10 as a factor and then adjusting results closer to target with the remaining numbers.

# **Observe**: Let's try another approach using `(10 + 13) - (9 - 4)`.

# **Test**: Calculate `(10 + 13) - (9 - 4)`.
# - 10 + 13 = 23;
# - 9 - 4 = 5;
# - 23 - 5 = 18.

# This still doesn't result in 24. We should attempt a new combination using all four numbers if possible.
# [0.1, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.6, 0.2]
# Ok(value='The agent has reached the maximum number of turns.')
