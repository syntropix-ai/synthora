@tool
def search_wikipedia(
    query: str, sentences: int = 5, auto_suggest: bool = False
) -> Result[str, Exception]:
    """Search Wikipedia and return a summary of the article.

    This function attempts to find and summarize a Wikipedia article based on the query.
    If the query is ambiguous, it returns the summary of the first suggested option.

    Args:
        query (str): The search query to look up on Wikipedia
        sentences (int, optional): Number of sentences to return in the summary. Defaults to 5
        auto_suggest (bool, optional): Whether to auto-suggest similar article titles.
                                     Defaults to False

    Returns:
        Result[str, Exception]: A Result object containing either:
            - Ok(str): The article summary if successful
            - Err(Exception): An error with description if the search fails

    Raises:
        ImportError: If the wikipedia package is not installed

    Examples:
        >>> result = search_wikipedia("Python programming")
        >>> if result.is_ok:
        ...     print(result.unwrap())
        ... else:
        ...     print(f"Error: {result.unwrap_err()}")

    Note:
        - Handles DisambiguationError by choosing the first suggested option
        - Handles PageError by returning an error message suggesting to try another query
        - Requires the 'wikipedia' package to be installed
