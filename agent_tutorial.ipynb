            "Acoustic seabed classification is the partitioning of a seabed acoustic image into discrete physical entities or classes. It is used to characterize the seabed and its habitats by linking the classified regions to their physical, geological, chemical, or biological properties.\n",

            "What are the two main categories of seabed classification based on acoustic properties?\n",

            "------------------------------\n",
            "What is the focus of surficial seabed classification?\n",
            "Surficial seabed classification is primarily concerned with distinguishing the marine benthic habitat characteristics such as hard, soft, rough, smooth, mud, sand, clay, and cobble of the surveyed area.\n",
            "------------------------------\n",
            "Which technologies are commonly used for surficial seabed classification?\n",
            "The most commonly used technologies for surficial seabed classification are multibeam echosounders, sidescan sonar systems, and acoustic ground discrimination systems (AGDS).\n",
            "------------------------------\n",
            "How does sub-surface imaging differ from surficial imaging in acoustic seabed classification?\n",
            "Sub-surface imaging uses lower frequency sound to achieve higher penetration, whereas surficial imaging employs higher frequencies to provide higher resolution imagery, especially in shallow water.\n",
            "------------------------------\n",
            "What are some of the technologies used for acoustic seabed classification?\n",
            "Technologies used for acoustic seabed classification include multibeam echosounders, sidescan sonar, single-beam echosounders, interferometric systems, and sub-bottom profilers.\n",
